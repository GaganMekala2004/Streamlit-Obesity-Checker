## Installation
To run this application, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Ensure your pre-trained model is in the correct format and accessible.

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

## Input Features
The application accepts the following input features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual (numeric).
- **Height**: Height of the individual in centimeters (numeric).
- **Weight**: Weight of the individual in kilograms (numeric).
- **Gender**: Gender of the individual (categorical: Male/Female).
- **Family History with Overweight**: Yes/No.
- **FAVC**: Frequency of consumption of high-calorie food (Yes/No).
- **FCVC**: Frequency of consumption of vegetables (numeric).
- **NCP**: Number of main meals consumed daily (numeric).
- **CAEC**: Consumption of food between meals (categorical).
- **SMOKE**: Smoking status (Yes/No).
- **CH2O**: Daily water intake in liters (numeric).
- **SCC**: Presence of stress (Yes/No).
- **FAF**: Physical activity level (numeric).
- **TUE**: Time spent on physical activity (numeric).
- **CALC**: Consumption of calcium (categorical).
- **MTRANS**: Mode of transportation (categorical).
- **Activity vs Calories**: Activity level compared to calorie intake (numeric).

## Model
The application uses a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier to make predictions based on the user input. The model was trained using a dataset of health metrics and achieved a high accuracy rate.
